/// Use a toggle to change the fill color of a shape
/// Learn about @State for our binding, because we're ///changing the value of the isToggled variable
///

///
/// #Part Three
/// More values, this time for the sliders to bind to
/// Sliders, the control, are introduced
///
/// #Part Four
/// We add a reset button
