# MyColorPicker

A package that implements the [Develop in Swift Explorations](http://apple.co/developinswiftexplorations) Color Picker project from Unit 4.

 # Part One
*  Use a toggle to change the fill color of a shape
* Learn about @State for our binding, because we're changing the value of the isToggled variable

 # Part Two
* We add more bindings
* We use a computed property to construct the color from the different toggles selected

 # Part Three
 * More values, this time for the sliders to bind to
 * Sliders, the control, are introduced

 # Part Four
 * We add a reset button
 * We also add a tintColor to all our switches and sliders
